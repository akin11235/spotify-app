# Music Data Display Application in Angular

## Project Overview
The Music Data Display Application is a web application built using Angular that interacts with the Spotify API to display music data. This application provides a user-friendly interface to search for music, view details about tracks, albums, and artists, and explore various music genres.

### Key Features
- **Spotify API Integration**: Fetches and displays music data from the Spotify API.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for tracks, albums, and artists.
- **Detailed View**: Displays detailed information about selected tracks, albums, and artists.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Project Flow
The application uses Angular components and services to interact with the Spotify API and present music data in the UI. The application is designed to handle user input, make API requests, and display results dynamically.

7. **Build the Application**  
   To build the application for production, use:
    ```bash
    ng build --prod
    ```

8. **Change Git Remote URL**  
    To avoid accidental pushes to the base project, change the Git remote URL:

    git remote -v # confirm the changes
    ```
